## A little about myself!

My name is William Bennett! I am currently a first year freshmen at Mizzou! 
I am enjoying my time so far in college and am trying a lot of new things! The first week of the semester I changed my major to Information Technology from Biology/Pre-Med major. It is a lot to take in but I think in the long run it will be a great choice for me.

Some of my hobbies are: 
1. playing volleyball 
2. video games. 
3. I am currently the manager of the Mizzou Women's Volleyball team. 
4. I work for Culinary Performance Services for *Mizzou Football* as well.
