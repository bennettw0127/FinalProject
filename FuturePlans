### Future Plans of Mine

I currently want to do something with Information Systems Management but seeing as that it is only my first semester here I am still open to change. Who knows, I might find something completely different that I will like. 

To be completely honest I have no idea what the future holds for me or what exactly I want to do with my degree. 

I would like to move out to the **west coast**
